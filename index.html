                PixaPulse ("the App") is a mobile application that uses Bluetooth technology to provide interactive experiences. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and disclose user and device data when you use the App. By using PixaPulse, you agree to the practices outlined below.
            </p>

        <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">We collect minimal data necessary to enable the App’s functionality:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Bluetooth Data:</strong> The App requires Bluetooth to detect broadcasted BLE beacon signals from event infrastructure, enabling synchronized light and vibration effects during live shows.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Location is used only to verify if you are within the bounds of a supported stadium or venue. This data is not tracked or stored.</li>
                <li><strong>Device-Related Data:</strong> The App may access basic device information or permissions, such as those needed for Bluetooth communication, to support its core features.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing:</strong> All data is processed temporarily in memory during use and discarded immediately after.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage and Sharing:</strong> No data is stored on the device or sent to the developer or third parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Data:</strong> The App does not collect personal information like names, emails, or user-generated content, and no user accounts are required.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Collected data is used only to make the App work as intended, enabling Bluetooth-based interactions. It is not used for analytics, advertising, or any other purpose.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>The App does not share any data with third parties, either on or off the device. All processing happens locally on your device.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Data is protected during use with standard security measures and is not stored after the App’s operation, reducing any risk of unauthorized access.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> Some data collection is required for the App to function and cannot be turned off without limiting features. You can manage permissions through your device settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Since data is only used temporarily and not stored, there is no data to delete. The App does not use user accounts.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App is intended for users aged 13 and older and is not designed for children under 13. It complies with applicable privacy laws, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">7. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The App uses third-party tools to support its functionality, such as Bluetooth communication. These tools do not collect or share data beyond what is needed for the App to work.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-8 mb-8">
